My hobby is to learn languages, specifically Japanese and French, so I made a website for learning Japanese.

I read through the deliverables, and from there decided on the pages of the website.
* Home, which will contain an image, a table, and a list
* Learn, which will contain an image, ordered and unordered lists, a Youtube video, and an audio file
* Links
* Contact, which will contain a form

I was inspired by the dark mode color palette of one of the Japanese resources I use that's composed of dark grays and bright oranges and yellows.
I found illustrations on another resource I use, and I chose the ones that matched my color palette. Both websites are also featured in the links menu!

I focused a lot on the nav bar. I tried to add more features to it like being able to drop down with links, adding a logo on one side and having the menu on the other, having hover effects, etc.
I also focused on trying to present information in a more interesting way so that it's not just one block of text. So I put them in ordered and unordered lists, added tables with design, and added a lot of media.
Last but not the least, I focused on making a form that's a different style than the one I made in class.
